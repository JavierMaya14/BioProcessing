BioProcessing is part of my masther's degree thesis project, it is designed to allow fast visualization and offline processing of four biomedical signals: electrocardiogram (ECG), phonocardiograma (PCG), respiratory wave and respiratory sounds. These signals are read from a .json file, generated by a portable svital signs monitor.
